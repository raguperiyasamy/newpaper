              r1Column <p>Put to bat first in the do-or-die match against Sri Lanka at the Dubai International Stadium, India lost both KL Rahul and Virat Kohli in the first three overs. Maheesh Theekshana bamboozled Rahul for just six off seven balls, while left-arm pacer Dilshan Madushanka castled down the middle and leg stumps to dismiss Kohli for a four-ball duck.

            <div class="col col3">
              r2Column <p>With two of his four sixes during the knock, Rohit went past former Pakistan captain Afridi to record the most number if sixes in Asia Cup history. Rohit now stands atop with 29 maximums in 31 Asia Cup appearances, three more that previous-record holder Afridi. The next best by an Indian on the list is veteran cricketer Suresh Raina, who on Tuesday announced his retirement from all forms of cricket, with 18 sixes.

              r3Column <p>En route to his fifty, Rohit also became the highest-scoring Indian cricketer in Asia Cup history, as he surpassed the legendary Sachin (970 runs). At the end of his fiery knock, Rohit also became the first India batter to score 1000 runs in Asia Cup and third overall, as his present tally stands at 1016 runs in 30 innings, standing only behind Sri Lanka greats Sanath Jayasuriya (1220 runs) and Kumar Sangakkara (1075 runs).</p>
